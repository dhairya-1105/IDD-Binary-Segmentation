# Road Segmentation using U-Net and DeepLabV3+ on IDD Dataset

This project applies binary semantic segmentation on the **IDD (Indian Driving Dataset)** to detect road regions in real-world driving conditions. The pipeline involves training and evaluating both **vanilla U-Net** and **DeepLabV3+** architectures using PyTorch.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Model        | IoU (%) | Dice Score (%) |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| U-Net        | 74.04   | 84.24          |
| DeepLabV3+   | 87.40   | 93.15          |


##  Models Used

- **U-Net**: A simple encoderâ€“decoder architecture used as the baseline.
- **DeepLabV3+**: Enhanced segmentation model with atrous convolutions and a ResNet backbone, significantly improving accuracy.
